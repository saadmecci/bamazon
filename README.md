# bamazon

A Node.js based storefront that uses MySQL to store information.

There are 2 ways to interact with the store: 1) Customer View or 2) Manager View.

The customer has access to item name and its price and can buy items which will deplete the stock in the SQL database.

The manager can view all items, items with low inventory, can add stock to low inventory items, and can add brand new items.
